The crops haven't produced enough to feed everyone, the ongoing wars with goblinkind to the south have prevented trade by the roads and an increase in bandit raids have left people with less than enough to survive. It seems as though a cloud of doom has settled over Tallowick, and there's no sign of it dispersing.You're barely scraping enough to get by as the local inn's night guard, but at least the job keeps a roof over your head. The Dusty Bottle scarcely sees half as many customers as it used to, and it's little wonder why. Who'd want to visit a back-end village in the middle of nowhere with little hopes of surviving the coming winter?Late one evening as you swap your last coin for a drink, the front door bursts open and in stumbles a raggedly dressed dwarf of a man who immediately approaches the bar. He throws a weather worn cloak over a stool and rumages through his pockets, cursing loudly upon discovering that he hasn't enough gold for a room.Taking pity on the poor soul, you reassure him that Old Stubbs the innkeep is a decent fellow and will surely put him up for the night, as most of his rooms are still withought lodgers. The dwarf mumbles an apology for his outburst and sits climbes the stool next to you."","Next","","","","""","4","","","","" 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 0, 0, 0, 0, 1"","","","","","""###################################################""@@@@@@" 2 0 4"" 1103"I beggin your pardon sir, but if being without a room was the extent of my worries, I'd not be grumbling. I've wasted three weeks up the Winterspine Mountains searching for a non existent treasure trove!" Your interest is suddenly piqued, and the dwarf agrees to elaborate his story over a swig of your drink.Over the remainder of the evening, the dwarf reveals his background as a travelling adventurer, with an ear for rumours and an eye for reward. "Which I can tell you go hand-in-hand." he adds with a wink. "But unfortunately my latest adventure turned out to be a dud.""Apparently there once existed a secret entrance to a long forgotten labyrinth, built deep underground by foul creatures of the Underdark. The labyrinth is supposedly home to many dangers, but also to many treasures, a mere handful of which would sustain a comfortable living."As he talks, the dwarf's words become more and more enticing, filling your head with mounds of gold and enchanted items.

"Whether or not the labyrinth exists is a mystery, but the secret entrance certainly does not." It takes him a few moments of rummaging through his pockets to produce a large sheet of folded parchment, which he carefully unfolds and spreads before you."I mapped the whole area where I thought the entrance ought to have been, but after three weeks of steady searching I was forced to return empty handed." He sighs heavily before adding: "I'm cutting my ties with this place. Tomorrow morning I'll move on and never look back at these miserable mountains."Seizing what might be your only opportunity, you ask the dwarf to part with the map, seeing as how he'll have no further use for it. He considers you carefully before responding. "Well... I could use a better travelling cloak, so I'll make an exchange if you like. But I warn you, you're wasting your time going up those mountains."After bidding the dwarf a good night, you take to your bed with dreams of wealth and glory.

From here on it's rough going though, as the slope steepens rapidly. You manage the first day without much trouble, although you notice a significant drop in temperature, but the second day proves much more difficult.By now frost covers every inch of ground, making it easy to miss your footing, and a single fall from this height would bring you all the way back down. You shudder at the thought and wonder how the dwarf ever managed! At last you reach the spot where the entrance is supposedly hidden. You rub your hands excitedly and waste no time getting to work.Hours drift by as you uproot every plant, turn every stone and search every crevice for some sort of pit, passage or doorway, but you find none. As night falls you begin to despair. What if the dwarf was right after all, and there really wasn't a labyrinth of untold riches?What if the dwarf had never believed in the labyrinth to begin with and merely tricked you out of your travelling cloak? Or what if the dwarf was a foul creature of the Underdark himself, luring you all the way up here so to reveal his true, hideous form and pounce upon your frail, mortal body!
